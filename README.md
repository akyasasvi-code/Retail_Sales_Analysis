🛒 Supermarket Sales Analysis
End-to-End Retail Data Analysis | Python | Pandas | Business Insights | EDA

This repository contains a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on Supermarket Sales data.
The goal is to uncover trends in customer behavior, revenue patterns, product performance, and operational efficiency.
The analysis is designed to support retail business decision-making through data-driven insights.

🔗 Google Colab Notebook (Optional)

If you want me to generate a custom Colab notebook link for this project as well, just tell me — I can create it in seconds.

📈 Key Insights from the Analysis
1️⃣ Sales & Revenue Trends

Month-wise revenue shows clear seasonal patterns.

Weekends and month-end periods often show peak sales.

2️⃣ Product Line Performance

Health & Beauty, Home & Lifestyle, and Food & Beverages are typically high-performing categories.

Product Line revenue varies significantly across branches.
